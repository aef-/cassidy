I.        OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cassidy is a blogging system written in Bourne shell/AWK/Sed. It uses
the filesystem permissions for security. A person with root access 
may create as many blogs as he likes and add/remove users from groups
that have access to those blogs.

All posts are stored on the filesystem in YAML. After creating a post 
you have the option of publishing it. Publishing involves generating
the HTML file from templates you've defined. Have a look at the rest
of the README to get a sense at how it can be used.



II.       INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cassidy is just a shell script, where you run it is up to you. It does
require a file to be created:

  # touch /etc/cassidy.conf

You can change the default config location in the shell script.
After that, you're all set. Run

  $ cassidy -h

for information on what you can do.



III.      GETTING STARTED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATING A BLOG:
You must have root access in order to create a blog.
Run 

  # cassidy create <blog>

What <blog> is has nothing to do with your actual site, it's just an
identifier between Cassidy and you/your bloggers. So it's best to keep 
it simple. Cassidy will ask you for some information that you can 
always change.


HELPFUL COMMANDS:
  List authors of a blog:
    getent group {groupname}

  Add author to a blog:
    useradd -G {group-name} {username}

  Remove user:
    usermod -G {groupname} {username}
